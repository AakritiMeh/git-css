                <h2 id="boxSizing">BOX SIZING</h2>
                <p>
                    when we reset box sizing as content box it may take up more space than that
                    <br>
                    while on the other hand if we set box sizing as border-box then it will take up only the amt of space that 
                    <br>
                    the content is actually written in....all of this in css reset
                </p>

                <h2 id="marginSizing">MARGIN and PADDING and BORDER and OUTLINE SIZING</h2>
                <p>
                    the margin shorthand when defined follows the order top right bottom left
                    <br>
                    it can be separately also though...the same applies for padding and border also
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Border--</strong>strong dotted dashed ridge
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Outline--</strong>it is simlar to but different from border..it does not really occupy space when we inspect the webpage
                    <br>when we give size in positive it is on the outside and when the size is in negative it is on the inside
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div id="circle">set the 
                        <br> border-radius as 
                        <br> half of width and
                        <br> height to make 
                        <br> it a circle
                    </div>
                </p>
